## Contributing Guidelines

### Issue Reporting

Before creating a new issue, please:

1. Check if the issue has already been reported
2. Use the appropriate issue template
3. Provide detailed information including:
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Expected vs actual behavior
   - Environment details (Node.js version, OS, etc.)
   - Error messages or logs

### Pull Request Process

1. **Create a feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes**:
   - Follow the coding standards
   - Write tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation as needed
   - Ensure all tests pass

3. **Commit your changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add new security feature"
   ```

4. **Push to your fork**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

5. **Create a Pull Request**:
   - Use the PR template
   - Provide a clear description of changes
   - Link related issues
   - Request reviews from maintainers

### Commit Message Convention

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

Types:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

Examples:
```
feat(security): add rate limiting middleware
fix(cors): handle multiple origin configurations
docs(readme): update installation instructions
test(express): add integration tests for adapter
```

### Code Style

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow ESLint and Prettier configurations
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use proper error handling

## Security Guidelines

### Security-First Development

- Always consider security implications of changes
- Follow OWASP guidelines
- Validate all inputs
- Use secure defaults
- Implement proper error handling
- Avoid exposing sensitive information

### Security Review Process

1. **Code Review**: All changes must be reviewed by at least one maintainer
2. **Security Testing**: New features must include security tests
3. **Vulnerability Assessment**: Regular security audits are performed
4. **Dependency Updates**: Keep dependencies updated and secure

### Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability:

1. **DO NOT** create a public issue
2. Email security@secure-backend.com or use GitHub Security Advisories
3. Provide detailed information about the vulnerability
4. Allow time for the security team to respond

## Testing Guidelines

### Test Structure

- Unit tests for individual functions and classes
- Integration tests for framework adapters
- Security tests for vulnerability prevention
- Performance tests for optimization validation

### Writing Tests

```typescript
describe('SecurityManager', () => {
  describe('validateJWT', () => {
    it('should reject tokens with alg:none', () => {
      const token = 'eyJhbGciOiJub25lIn0.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIn0.';
      const result = securityManager.validateJWT(token);
      expect(result.valid).toBe(false);
      expect(result.error).toBe('alg:none not allowed');
    });
  });
});
```

### Test Coverage

- Aim for 90%+ code coverage
- Test both success and failure scenarios
- Test edge cases and boundary conditions
- Mock external dependencies appropriately

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test suites
npm run test:security
npm run test:performance
npm run test:integration

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

## Documentation Guidelines

### Code Documentation

- Use JSDoc for all public APIs
- Include examples in documentation
- Document security considerations
- Keep documentation up to date

### README Updates

- Update README.md for new features
- Add usage examples
- Update installation instructions
- Include security considerations

### API Documentation

- Document all configuration options
- Provide TypeScript examples
- Include security best practices
- Add troubleshooting guides

## Release Process

### Version Management

We follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):

- **MAJOR**: Breaking changes
- **MINOR**: New features (backward compatible)
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes (backward compatible)

### Release Steps

1. **Update version** in `package.json`
2. **Update CHANGELOG.md** with changes
3. **Create release branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b release/v1.0.0
   ```
4. **Run full test suite**:
   ```bash
   npm run test:coverage
   npm run build
   ```
5. **Create GitHub release** with tag
6. **Publish to npm** (automated via CI/CD)
